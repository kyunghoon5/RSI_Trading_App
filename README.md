# RSI_Trading_App
Software Engineering Project: RSI Trading App
Domain analysis and requirements specification
Introduction: 
The goal of RSI Trading App is to provide users anAndroid application where independent stock traders can simulate the buying and selling of stocks on the US stock exchange and receive guidance on the best times to carry out transactions using historical stock data and computer algorithms that analyze the RSI (Relative Strength Index) of a stock. RSI Trading App will streamline the process of trading by filtering and analyzing the vast amount of stock data stored in the Bloomberg database and distilling it to a simple indicator that the user should buy, sell, or holda particular stock. Users will create their own profile where they can choose which stocks they would like the application to track. Being a platform that simulates trading, there will be no need for the user to specify too much of their private information, so the profiles stored on the application user database will be more secure. A simple user interface will make the application a less intimidating option for users who are new to trading, and for more experienced users, it is a tool that will minimize the amount of stock analysis they would have to do on their own. 


Glossary:
RSI (Relative Strength Index): a measurement of the magnitude of recent price changes in a given stock. RSI value for a stock can be between 0-100 and a value of ~70 means the stock is being over bought/overvalued, and ~30 means the stock is being under bought/undervalued. In general, it may be a good idea to buy when the RSI is low and sell when it is high, as extreme values in RSI can indicate that there will be a future reversal in a stockâ€™s trend. 
Momentum Strategies: speculative trading strategies that hypothesize that a current trend in a given stock price is going to continue. 
Mean Regression Strategies: strategies that hypothesize that stock prices will continue to center around an average price.
